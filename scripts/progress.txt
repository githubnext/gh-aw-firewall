### Task: Monitor and verify CI checks for PR #356

**Initial State:**
- PR #356 had a failing PR Title Check due to unknown scope "scripts"
- Other checks (Smoke Claude, Smoke Copilot, Security Guard) were in progress

**Actions Taken:**
1. Checked PR status - found PR title had already been updated to use "ci" scope
2. Monitored remaining checks until completion
3. Verified all 35 CI checks passed

**Result:**
- All CI checks are now GREEN ✅
- PR is ready for review/merge

**No code changes were required** - the PR title fix had already been applied in a previous session.
