# Progress: Fix Smoke Copilot Test Failures

## 2026-01-22

### Investigation Complete

**Root cause identified**: The smoke-copilot workflow fails because the MCP Gateway is not being set up properly.

**Key findings:**
1. The `smoke-copilot.lock.yml` was compiled by gh-aw v0.36.0 but is missing the "Start MCP gateway" step
2. The workflow tries to run GitHub MCP server via `docker run` inside the AWF container, which doesn't have Docker access
3. The `release.lock.yml` workflow shows the correct pattern - it uses an MCP Gateway running on the host machine

**Next steps:**
- Need to recompile smoke-copilot.lock.yml with gh-aw that properly handles sandbox.mcp configuration
- Or manually add the MCP Gateway step to smoke-copilot.lock.yml

**Updated PRD** with detailed investigation results and resolution options.
