## Version Reporting

**IMPORTANT**: In your final report or issue, include the following version information:

- **gh-aw version**: [Check the `cli_version` field in your workflow's compiled .lock.yml file]

This helps track which version of GitHub Agentic Workflows was used to generate the results. The version can be found in the lock file metadata at the top of the compiled workflow file.
