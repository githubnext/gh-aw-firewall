# Release Process

This document describes how to create a new release of the agentic-workflow-firewall (awf).

## Prerequisites

- Push access to the repository
- Ability to create and push tags

## Release Steps

### 1. Update Version

Update the version in `package.json`:

```bash
# For a patch release (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)
npm version patch

# For a minor release (0.1.1 -> 0.2.0)
npm version minor

# For a major release (0.2.0 -> 1.0.0)
npm version major
```

This will:
- Update `package.json` version
- Create a git commit with the version change
- Create a git tag (e.g., `v0.1.1`)

### 2. Push Changes and Tag

```bash
# Push the version commit
git push origin main

# Push the tag (this triggers the release workflow)
git push origin --tags
```

### 3. Monitor Release Workflow

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Watch the **Release** workflow run
3. The workflow will:
   - Build TypeScript
   - Build and push Docker images to GHCR
   - Create Linux x64 binary
   - Create NPM tarball
   - Generate checksums
   - Publish GitHub Release

### 4. Verify Release

Once the workflow completes:

1. Go to **Releases** page
2. Verify the new release is published with:
   - Linux x64 binary (`awf-linux-x64`)
   - NPM tarball (`awf.tgz`)
   - Checksums file (`checksums.txt`)
   - Installation instructions with GHCR image references
3. Go to **Packages** page (in repository)
4. Verify Docker images are published:
   - `squid:<version>` and `squid:latest`
   - `agent:<version>` and `agent:latest`

## Manual Release

If you need to trigger a release manually without creating a new tag:

1. Go to **Actions** â†’ **Release** workflow
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select branch (usually `main`)
4. Click **Run workflow**

This will create a release using the version from `package.json`.

## Release Artifacts

Each release includes:

### GitHub Release Assets
- `awf-linux-x64` - Linux x64 standalone executable
- `awf.tgz` - NPM package tarball (alternative installation method)
- `checksums.txt` - SHA256 checksums for all files

### GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
Docker images are published to `ghcr.io/githubnext/gh-aw-firewall`:
- `squid:<version>` and `squid:latest` - Squid proxy container
- `agent:<version>` and `agent:latest` - Agent execution environment

These images are automatically pulled by the CLI when running commands.

## Testing a Release Locally

Before pushing a tag, you can test the build process locally:

### Test Binary Creation

```bash
# Install pkg globally
npm install -g pkg

# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Create Linux binary
mkdir -p release
pkg . --targets node18-linux-x64 --output release/awf

# Test the binary (requires Docker images - see below)
./release/awf-linux --help
```

### Test Docker Images Locally

```bash
# Build images locally
docker build -t awf-test/squid:local ./containers/squid
docker build -t awf-test/agent:local ./containers/agent

# Test with local images
sudo ./dist/cli.js \
  --build-local \
  --allow-domains github.com \
  'curl https://github.com'

# Or test with existing GHCR images
sudo ./dist/cli.js \
  --allow-domains github.com \
  'curl https://github.com'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Release workflow fails

1. Check the **Actions** tab for error logs
2. Common issues:
   - Build errors: Check TypeScript compilation locally with `npm run build`
   - Docker build errors: Test image builds locally in `containers/` directories
   - GHCR push errors: Ensure `packages: write` permission is granted
   - Permission errors: Ensure repository has `contents: write` permission

### Binary doesn't work

1. Test locally before release
2. Ensure all dependencies are bundled (check `pkg.assets` in package.json)
3. For dynamic requires, you may need to mark files/directories in `pkg.assets`

### Docker images not available

If users report that Docker images can't be pulled:

1. Check **Packages** page to verify images were published
2. Verify image visibility is set to **Public** (not Private)
3. Check image tags match what the CLI expects (version + latest)
4. Users can use `--build-local` as a workaround while troubleshooting

To make packages public:
1. Go to repository **Packages** page
2. Click on the package (squid or agent)
3. Go to **Package settings**
4. Change visibility to **Public**

### Version mismatch

If you accidentally pushed the wrong version:

1. Delete the tag locally: `git tag -d v0.1.0`
2. Delete the tag remotely: `git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.0`
3. Delete the release from GitHub UI
4. Delete or retag the GHCR images if needed
5. Fix the version and retry

## Pre-release Versions

For alpha, beta, or release candidate versions:

```bash
# Alpha release
npm version prerelease --preid=alpha  # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1-alpha.0

# Beta release
npm version prerelease --preid=beta   # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1-beta.0

# Release candidate
npm version prerelease --preid=rc     # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1-rc.0
```

The workflow automatically marks releases containing `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc` as pre-releases on GitHub.

## Maintenance Releases

For backporting fixes to older major versions:

1. Create a maintenance branch: `git checkout -b v0.x`
2. Cherry-pick or apply fixes
3. Update version: `npm version patch`
4. Push branch and tag: `git push origin v0.x --tags`

The release workflow works the same for maintenance branches.
