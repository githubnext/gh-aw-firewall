# Environment Variables

## Usage

```bash
# Pass specific variables
awf -e MY_API_KEY=secret 'command'

# Pass multiple variables
awf -e FOO=1 -e BAR=2 'command'

# Pass all host variables (development only)
awf --env-all 'command'
```

## Default Behavior

When using `sudo -E`, these host variables are automatically passed: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `USER`, `TERM`, `HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

The following are always set/overridden: `PATH` (container values).

Variables from `--env` flags override everything else.

**Note:** As of v0.13.5, `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` are no longer automatically set. Traffic is transparently redirected to Squid via iptables NAT rules. If needed, you can still set these manually with `--env HTTP_PROXY=...`

## Security Warning: `--env-all`

Using `--env-all` passes all host environment variables to the container, which creates security risks:

1. **Credential Exposure**: All variables (API keys, tokens, passwords) are written to `/tmp/awf-<timestamp>/docker-compose.yml` in plaintext
2. **Log Leakage**: Sharing logs or debug output exposes sensitive credentials
3. **Unnecessary Access**: Extra variables increase attack surface (violates least privilege)
4. **Accidental Sharing**: Easy to forget what's in your environment when sharing commands

**Excluded variables** (even with `--env-all`): `PATH`, `PWD`, `OLDPWD`, `SHLVL`, `_`, `SUDO_*`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `NO_PROXY`, `no_proxy`

**Proxy variables:** Host proxy settings are excluded to prevent conflicts with iptables-based traffic redirection. The firewall uses transparent proxying via iptables NAT rules instead of environment variable-based proxy configuration.

## Best Practices

✅ **Use `--env` for specific variables:**
```bash
sudo awf --allow-domains github.com -e MY_API_KEY="$MY_API_KEY" 'command'
```

✅ **Use `sudo -E` for auth tokens:**
```bash
sudo -E awf --allow-domains github.com 'copilot --prompt "..."'
```

⚠️ **Use `--env-all` only in trusted local development** (never in production/CI/CD)

❌ **Avoid `--env-all` when:**
- Sharing logs or configs
- Working with untrusted code
- In production/CI environments

## Internal Environment Variables

The following environment variables are set internally by the firewall and used by container scripts:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AWF_DNS_SERVERS` | Comma-separated list of trusted DNS servers | `8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4` |
| `AWF_CHROOT_ENABLED` | Whether chroot mode is enabled | `true` |
| `AWF_HOST_PATH` | Host PATH passed to chroot environment | `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin` |
| `NO_PROXY` | Domains bypassing Squid (host access mode) | `localhost,host.docker.internal` |

**Note:** These are set automatically based on CLI options and should not be overridden manually.

**Historical note:** Prior to v0.13.5, `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` were set to point to Squid. These have been removed in favor of transparent iptables-based redirection, which is more reliable and avoids conflicts with tools that don't honor proxy environment variables.

## Troubleshooting

**Variable not accessible:** Use `sudo -E` or pass explicitly with `--env VAR="$VAR"`

**Variable empty:** Check if it's in the excluded list or wasn't exported on host (`export VAR=value`)
